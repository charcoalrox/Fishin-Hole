# Fishin-Hole
A Gameboy ROM recreation of the game in the book End of Watch by Stephen King

#Compile Fishin' Hole:
Simply run the make.bat file.  It'll create a version with the original blue flashes and one without (for people who either want to avoid flashing lights or prefer not to have the more negative content present)
The make.bat file is tested to run on Windows 11. It may work elsewhere but I have not checked
